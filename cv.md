### Profile

For many years I worked as a project manager in the publishing business. At the beginning of 2020, I caught a professional burnout, recovered, and decided to change the field of activity with renewed forces. I started learning coding in November 2020. I posted my learning way on Reddit and with this story in December [🏆 won](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperskill/comments/keu4ad/just_try_it_i_found_funny_pics_to_entertain_and/) the competition [Hour of Code](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperskill/comments/k02pxr/hour_of_code_with_jetbrains_academy_get_a_chance/) from JetBrains Academy.

I get pleasure from any system. I like to organize things and make them beautiful. I think it's perfectly connected in the front-end developer journey. I don't like inefficiency and wasted energy consumption, so I always looking for ways to improve something and automate routine operations. 

I love to learn everything around and I'm not afraid to get bumps: I mastered a bicycle at the age of 25.\
I can clearly explain everything I know myself. I can teach and motivate other people.\ 
I'm a non-destructive perfectionist, but I'm struggling with it, so one of the tests in RSS I passed at 97/100.

### Passions

I read a lot, especially love 19th-century French literature.\
I am interested in psychology and mindfulness practices. \
I like mobile photography and now studying the theory of photography. \
I am interested in interior design, apartment planning, renovation. \
Sometimes I draw — in digital or using watercolors. \
I walk a lot. \
I love birds, especially magpies and owls. I am engaged in birdwatching from the window of the flat. I can name five types of titmice. I hang the bird feeder in winter. I know how to feed different birds correctly and I preach this knowledge in parks and squares.
